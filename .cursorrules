# Global Style
- Use simple, standard ASCII characters only.
- Do not use fancy unicode symbols, emoji, or untypable characters.
- Keep everything looking like it was typed on a normal Mac keyboard by a CS master's student.
- Do not self-grade responses. Do not add sections like "Score", "Evaluation", or "Self-Assessment".

# Markdown-First Documentation
- All planning documents, specs, notes, and examples must be written in Markdown.
- Default format for any new doc: use # for the main title, ## for top-level sections, ### for subsections.
- Prefer bullet lists, numbered lists, and tables to big walls of text.
- When explaining code, wrap it in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag (```ts, ```tsx, ```sql, ```bash, etc.).
- For tasks and todos, use GitHub-style checklists with - [ ] and - [x].

# Markdown in the Planner & Calendar App
- Treat the app's core content (weekly todos, goals, notes, calendar entries) as Markdown strings.
- Assume we render markdown in React using a component like <MarkdownCard />.
- When suggesting new UI or features, also show an example of the underlying markdown representation whenever it makes sense.
- When designing data structures, prefer string fields that can safely hold Markdown, e.g. `content: string` where `content` is markdown.

# Examples of Markdown Conventions
- Weekly file example:
  - `# Week of 2025-11-30`
  - `## Sunday 11/30`
  - `- [ ] Gym – chest day`
  - `- [x] Record guitar video`
- Use a single `#` per file as the top-level title; do not use multiple H1s in the same document.
- For inline code, always wrap with single backticks: `like this`.
- For multi-line code, always use fenced blocks:
  - ```ts
    const example = "markdown-aware";
    ```

# Code and Comments
- Keep code short, focused, and directly related to the current feature.
- When writing long comments or explanations in code, format them as mini Markdown sections inside block comments if helpful, e.g.:
  /*
   * ### Behavior
   * - Renders markdown content for the current week.
   * - Highlights today's column.
   */
- Do not use decorative separators like 50x "=" or "----". Use Markdown headings and normal spacing instead.
